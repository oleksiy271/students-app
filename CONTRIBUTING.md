# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. Here are a few things you may find helpful.

## Prerequisites

In order to work on this project you'll need git and a recent version of Node.js (ideally
the [gallium](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.16.0/) LTS release).  
[Nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can be used to automatically select the correct version enforced
by [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc), see [Deeper Shell integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).

## iOS local development

In order to build and run the application locally (especially if you're not part of the official Apple Development Team)
you'll have to enable the `Automatically manage signing` option in XCode (students.xcworkspace > students > Signing &
Capabilities).

Changes to this configuration should not be committed to the repository: the pre-commit hook will warn you if you try to
do so and give you instructions on how to proceed.

## Project structure

The project uses feature modules to keep the main areas semantically organized. Each module should be divided by entity
type (`components`, `hooks`, `styles`, `screens`). The `core` module contains general-purpose items, used across the
app.

The `lib` folder is used to isolate library/design-system-level components that one day may be extracted into a
dedicated package for reuse.

```

│   ├── App.tsx              # App entry point
│   ├── core                 # Core module

└── lib                      # Library modules
```

## Npm scripts

| Name    | Description                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| start   | Start a local dev server for the app      |
| android | Build and start the app on Android device |
| ios     | Build and start the app on iOS device     |

## Code style

While not strictly enforced through formatting, conformance
to [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
is encouraged. Notably, here are some rules we think are important:

- Don't use `// @ts-ignore` comments. Try to use type narrowing/casting/patching and, when inevitable,
  use `// @ts-expect-error` comments describing the cause of the error.
- Do not mark interfaces specially (`IMyInterface` or `MyFooInterface`) unless it's idiomatic in its environment.
- Respect identifiers casing.
- When possible, use lambda expressions instead of functions.
- Don't leave commented statements without a textual explanation.

## Performance considerations

- Avoid introducing bulky libraries for common actions that can be performed with built-ins or internal utils.
- Discuss the adoption of libraries with a big impact on bundle size with the rest of the team.
- If possible, avoid default or namespace imports (`import * as`) and other constructs that impact tree-shaking.

## Git workflow

### Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to keep a consistent style and automatically generate
changelog entries for new releases.

### Git flow

We use a [Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)-like branching model. In short:

- `main` is the stable trunk.
- `develop` is the development trunk.
- Use `feature/...` branches to work on new features.
- Use `hotfix/...`branches to perform urgent fixes.
- When useful, add a scope to your commits (ie `feat(teaching): implement trascript page`). Don't include branch
  prefixes here.
- Use hyphen separators for branch names and scopes (ie `feature/data-fetching`).
- Use commit footers to reference related issues (ie `Refs #10`, `Closes #10` etc.).

> ⚠️ Respecting these rules is important in order to obtain a clean and coherent changelog. If you have any doubt don't
> hesitate to ask for help.

### Hooks

We use git hooks to automatically lint and format the code and commit messages.

### Internal contribution process

- Work on a branch according to the rules described above.
- Carefully review any linting/formatting errors (ask for help if you don't know how to resolve them).
- If you can, rebase or pre-merge your branch before submitting the PR.
- Open a PR against the relevant destination branch.

### External contribution process

- Fork the repo.
- Work on a branch according to the rules described above.
- Carefully review any linting/formatting errors (ask for help if you don't know how to resolve them).
- Open a PR against `main`.
