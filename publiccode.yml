      The new PoliTO Students App, born in 2023 thanks to a **collaborative
      design approach**, is characterized by a **user experience designed on the
      students needs**, who was involved from the early stages of development,
      through interviews and focus groups. Furthermore, the development team
      included two Computer Engineering students, who worked in synergy with the
      University staff.


      Now the students can have everything they need for life at the University.


      - The main section, "**Teaching**", presents the courses, an extract of
      the available exams and the booklet with your career in a single screen.
      The display of courses is customizable: you can select which ones to see
      and customize their appearance with colors and icons.

      - The "**Agenda**" section, completely renewed, presents the daily and
      weekly commitments at the University, aggregating lessons, exams,
      reservations and deadlines.

      - The "**Places**" section has been redesigned with a view to facilitating
      movement within the University and searching for places. The plans of the
      different floors of the city offices have been integrated into a
      geo-database to be able to be used on top of the cartographic base
      provided by _Open Street Map_. A marker system presents the main
      categories of places the students are interested in, allowing immediate
      orientation within the buildings. You can search for a place by name or by
      category.


      The application is available on the Google Play store for Android devices
      and in the Apple store.
